My violence is a dream
A 'real dream'
A skinny arm
A crush on living sin
My violence
Is a sleeping head
Nodding out to rising bliss
I left home for experience
Carved 'suk for honesty' on my chest
My violence is the number
Coming out of prayer
Find it in the father
Find it in a girl
There's a thing in my memory
Hoilding on for dear life
With a feeling of secrets
Beating up under my flesh
My tongue is tied
I'm sleeping nights awake
Tom violence is a dream
Coming out of a girl
----
Met a stranger on a train
He bumped right into me
I swear I didn't mean it
I swear it wasn't meant to be
Must a been a dream
From a thousand years ago
I swear I didn't mean it
I swear it wasn't meant to be
From the bottom of my heart
He was looking all over me
Together everafter
He said
"You take me & I'll be you"
"You kill him & I'll kill her"
Kiss me
I swear it wasn't meant to be
I swear I didn't mean it
Kiss me
Kiss me in the shadow of
Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
Kiss me
Kiss me in the shadow
Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
It's just a dream
It's just a dream I had
Nononoooooh
Swear it's just a dream
Just a dream
Dream I've had
No
No
No
No
Take me to it
Take me to her
Maybe
Maybe it's just a dream
It's a dream
It's just a
Just a
No
Met a stranger on a train
Bumped right into me
Swear I didn't mean it
Swear it wasn't meant to be
Must've been a dream
From a thousand years ago
Kiss me
Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
Kiss me
----
Spinning dreams with angel wings
Torn blue jeans, a foolish grin
Burning down in the night
So cool, so right
Starpower starpower starpower
Over me
She knows how to make love to me
She knows how to make love
Close my eyes and think of you
Everything turns black to blue
Starpower starpower starpower
Over me
Burning down in the night
Supercool it's alright
She knows how to make love to me
She knows how to make love
Close my mind when I think of you
Everything turns black to blue
Starpower starpower starpower
Over me
----
They were
Aaaah
He did what he had to do
He asked no questions
He had few conversations
The tar glistens in the noon heat
He tread across the grass, up onto, and down off of, the concrete abutments
Mirage on the highway
Ghosts in the tunnel
The dark cave
Out into the blinding light of day at breakneck speed
Every bolt rumbling
Glistening highway mirage groans
The slick surface
Careening into first the small mammal, and then screeching along the guard
Rail, scraping paint and throwing sparks like sheets of pure terror for
400 yards
Over and over
With one final back and forth rocking motion coming to rest
Wheeehah
The beautiful paintjob hopelessly marred
Smoke and flames
Allright
So nice
He moved to the small creature
Screeching whistles of steam blowing off
On it's back, wheels spinning like a cinema classic
The door sags open and a man covered in blood drops the three feet or so to
The pavement
The car still rattling and shaking as if with a mind of it's own, unwilling
To die
The man, 40ish, also after a time, an agonisingly painful period of time
Is also unwilling to die
Suddenly all is quite quiet there in the sunlight on the highway
But what? what can I do?
I cannot move, everything is about broken
Blood everywhere, mixing with oil and gas
What's moving, must turn my head
Pain, white light, blinded
Some guy there kneeling in the blinded mirage of white light
All my strength to 'heeeeeelp'
Screaming now help me please
He tried to tamp out the bit of burning ember which had lept from the wreck
Onto his grimy coatsleeve
Coughing blood
What's happen?
He's he's inching towards truth
He strode of into the woods with the animal
It still lived
He didn't glance back at all
Still out ghosting the road
Death on the highway
Words crumble around me and fall with the weight of heaven
I cannot move
I'm beneath the great weight
I cannot see
My eyes are blinded
I am in the darkness
That's it
----
I kneel before the green light
Of her singing crayon eyes
And then I kiss her stomach
And it's then I realize:
Her light is the night
I'm not blind, I believe in you
I see a green light
I see a green light
I see a green light
----
I went away to see an old friend of mine
His sister came over she was out of her mind
She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin
She was laughing like crazy, at the trouble I'm in
Her light eyes were dancing, she is insane
Her brother says she's just a bitch, with a golden chain
She keeps coming closer saying "I can feel it in my bones"
The schizophrenia is taking me home
My future is static
It's already had it
I could tuck you in
And we can talk about it
I had a dream
And it split the scene
But I got a hunch
It's coming back to me
----
I got a catholic block
Inside my head
I let it go to work
Bring it all back home
It serves you right
And I can motor down
You got to earn your freedom
Get it on my own
I just live forever
There just is no end
I just trust the repression
Like I trust your friends
I got a catholic block
Inside my head
I let it play around
Iron to gold
Come back to me awhile
I got a catholic block it's around my head
I got a catholic block and it's blood orange red
I got a catholic block do you like to fuck?
I got a catholic block guess I'm out of luck
----
There's something in the air there
That makes you go insane
Brings you back to me
It's been so long
All that I have to do
Is live along
It's coming coming down
Over me
Do you want to see
The explosions in my eye
Do you want to see
The reflection of
How we used to be
Beauty lies
In the eyes of another's dream
Beauty lies
Lost in anothers dream
It's coming coming down
Over me
Do you want to see
The explosions in my eye
Do you want to see
The reflection of
How it used to be
Hey baby
Hey sweetheart
Hey fox come here
Hey beautiful
Come here sugar
----
I'm keeping my commission to faith's transmission
Two speakers dream the same and skies turn red
Satellites flashing down orchard and delancey
I can't get laid cuz everyone is dead
Hey, gold connections
Analog soul waving in your hair
Hey, hylozoic directions
She's talking blue streaks everywhere
Your spirit is time-reversed to your body
Stereographic mix-up field on field
It started growing up the day your body dies
Only apparently, real to irreal
Hey, stereo stations
Perfect image, kneel down
Hey, hypostatic information
Come on let's hear you turn it around
----
Stretch me to the point where I stop
Run ten thousand miles and then think of me
I think you know the place we should meet
Don't worry if it's dark and I'm late
Run me out a thin wire
Help me to kill this, love
I'll meet you tonite at the bottom of the well
Just feel around in the dark until you get the idea
I'm not moving doesn't mean I can't
Flame on in my head
My best friend sucked his wife's blood an shriveled up
He was mistaken for sane
We move and groove and cut loose from fear
We should kill time, we'll shut it down
I've got a pipeline straight to the heart of you
Opening in my head
Bright glass on a chair being wound around us
The toiling of idle hands
Dripping,
With guilt
A secret form of punishment
Axes thru skulls
Shadow of futility
Endless revolt
The shining of light and shadows
Dividing each existance
No-one is right
Nothing is solid
Nothing can be held in my hands for long
Discontinuity
Sandy beaches
Bridges sinking into the sea
Beautiful confusion
You're a fading memory
We should kill time
----
You're it
No, you're it
Hey, you're really it
You're it
No I mean it, you're it
Say it
Don't spray it
Spirit desire (face me)
Spirit desire (don't displace me)
Spirit desire
We will fall
Miss me
Don't dismiss me
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
We will fall
Spirit desire
We will fall
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
Spirit desire
We will fall
Spirit desire
We will fall
Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather
And what's a man do to but work out whether it's true?
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper
Who can open up a map and see between one and two
Time to get it
Before you let it
Get to you
Here he comes now
Stick to your guns
And let him through
Everybody's coming from the winter vacation
Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes
With Marshall stacks
To at least just give us a clue
Ah, here it comes
I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station
Gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you
Now I see it
I think I'll leave it out of the way
Now I come near you
And it's not clear why you fade away
Looking for a ride to your secret location
Where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation, for you
Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now
It better work out
I hope it works out my way
'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head
Takes a teen age riot to get me out of bed right now
You better look it
We're gonna shake it
Up to him
He acts the hero
We paint a zero
On his hand
We know it's down
We know it's bound too loose
Everybody's sound is round it
Everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather
You're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze
It's time to go round
A one man showdown
Teach us how to fail
We're off the streets now
And back on the road
On the riot trail
----
Snake in it
Jack into the wall
TV amp on fire
Blowin' in the hall
Gun your sled
Close your peeping toms
Turbo organizer
Crankin' on the knob
You got it
Yeh ride the silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin hole in your pocket
Hit the power
Psycho helmets on
You got to splice your halo
Take it to a moon
Nymphoid clamor
Fuelling up the hammer
You got to fake out the robot
And pulse up the zoom
You got it
Yeh ride the silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin hole in your pocket
Can't forget the flashing
Can't forget the smashing
The sending and the bending
The atmosphere re-entry
You gotta have the time
Got a letter in your mind
Gotta heart injection
That you got yourself a line
You got it
Yeh ride the silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin hole in your pocket
----
To the extent that I wear skirts
And cheap nylon slips
I've gone native
I wanted to know the exact dimension of hell
Does this sound simple?
Fuck you! Are you for sale?
Does 'Fuck you' sound simple enough?
This was the only part that turned me on
But he was candy all over
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
I grew up in a shotgun row
Sliding down the hill
Out front were the big machines
Steel and rusty now I guess
Outback was the river
And that big sign down the road
That's where it all started
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
You can buy some more, more, more, more

Let's go walking on the water
Come all the way please
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?
No need to be scared
Let's jump into the day
I wanna know
I think I oughta go
Close your eyes and make believe
You can do whatever you please
I wanna know
I think I better go
Let's go walkin on water
Now you think I'm Satan's daughter
I wanna know
Please let me go!
Just too quick
Now I think I'm gonna be sick
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?
I'm trying for the future
It's funny that way
I wanna know
I wanna know!
I took a look into the hate
It made me feel very up to date
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?
Hold me tight, down on my knees
So I don't go burning 'cross the breeze
I wanna know
I wanna know!
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?
Burning 'cross the breeze
Burning 'cross the breeze
Blowing 'cross the breeze
----
I can't see anything at all, all I see is me
That's clear enough
And that's whats important, to see me
My eyes can focus
My brain is talking
Looks pretty good to me
My head's on straight, my girlfriend's beautiful
Looks pretty good to me
Sometimes I speak
Tonight there's nothing to say
Sometimes we freak
And laugh all day
Hold these pages up to the light
See the jacknife inside of the dream
A railroad runs through the record stores at night
Coming in for the deep freeze
"Mary", a simple word, are you there in the country?
Your eyes so full, your head so tight
Can't you hear me?
Remember our talk
That day on the phone?
I was the door, and you were the station
With shattered glass and miles between us
We still flew away in the conversation
My cup is full, and I feel okay
The world is dull, but not today
She think's she's a goddess
She says she talks to the spirits
I wonder if she can talk to herself?
If she can bear to hear it?
This is Eric's trip
We've all come to watch him slip
He's slipping all the way to Texas
Can you dig it?
I see with a glass eye
The pavement view
A shadow forming, across the fields rushing
Through me to you
We tore down the world, and put up four walls
I breathe in the myth
I'm over the city, fucking the future
I'm high and inside your kiss
We can't see clear
But what we see is a alright
We make up what we can't hear
And then we sing all night
Scattered pages and shattered lights
A jacknife and a dream
There's something moving over there on the right
Like nothing I've never seen
----
Here we go to another candle I know
All the girls there playin' on a jelly roll
Time to take a ride, time to take it in a midnite eye
And if you wanna go, get on below
Pinking out the day, dreaming out the crazy way
Finger on the love, it's all above
Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck
Time to rock the road, and tell the story of the jelly rollin'
Dirty boots are on, hi di ho
Pinking out the black, dreaming in a crack
Satan got her tongue
Now it's undone
I got some dirty boots, yeah dirty boots
I got some dirty boots, baby
Dirty boots
Hey!

Dreaming, dreaming of a girl like me
Hey what are you waiting for
Feeding, feeding me
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in the mirror, and I'm bigger in every way
She said,
"You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere"
I'm in heaven now, I can see you Richard
Goodbye Hollywood, goodbye downey
Hello Janis,
Hello Dennis, Elvis, and all my brand new friends
I'm so glad you're all here with me, until the very end
Dreaming, dreaming of how it's supposed to be
But now this tunic's spinning
Around my arms and knees
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But when I open my mouth to sing
I'm bigger in every way
She said,
"You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere"
Hey mom, look, I'm up here, I finally made it
I'm playing the drums again too
Don't be sad, the band doesn't sound half bad
And I remember mom, what you said
You said "honey, you look so under-fed"
Another green salad, another ice tea
There's a tunic in the closet
Waiting just for me
I feel like I'm disappearing, getting smaller every day
But I look in your eyes, and I'm bigger in every way
She said,
"You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere"
Goodbye Richard, gotta go now
I'm finally on my own, but Dan's got a gig
Keep the love lights glowing, little girl's got the blues
I can still hear momma say, "honey, don't let it go to your head"

Talking to a punk rock priest
Just dogging the breeze
About beein in a tree (he says it's free now!)
Along comes Mary Christ
Skating light on ice
And says, 'let's go on high' (later, priestoid!)
You gotta go
God I got a date now
Yeh I know
Shall not be late now
Possessed by x-ray eyes
Her spirit spy's
Into my lies (let's burn 'em out now!)
Wraps my head in skin
Says now I'm in
Dig the candy skin (yeh spit it out now!)
Everytime
She sings that low song
Everytime
I know I'm right, wrong
Angel in a devil skirt
Buys me a shirt
Says I hope you like (uh, like what now!?)
Hope I hope you like
Like you like your hope
With the tightest rope (I see, I know now!)
Here we go
I've been waitin so long
Yeh I know
For Mary to come along

Kool Thing sittin' with a kitty
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Like a lover not a dancer
Superboy take a chance here
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
Kool Thing let me play it with your radio
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I'll be your slave
Give you a shave
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
Yeah, tell'em about it,
Hit'em where it hurts
Hey, Kool Thing, come here, sit down
There's something I gotta ask you.
I just wanna know, what are you gonna do for me?
I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls
From male white corporate oppression?
Tell it like it is!
Huh?
Yeah!
Don't be shy
Word up!
Fear of a female planet?
Fear of a female planet?
Fear, baby!
I just want to know that we can still be friends
Come on, come on, come on, come on let everybody know
Kool thing, kool thing
When you're a star, I know you'll fix everything
Kool Thing sittin' with a kitty
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Rock the beat just a little faster
Now I know you are the master
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
Kool thing walkin' like a panther
Come on and give me an answer
Kool thing walkin' like a panther
What'd he say?
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so

When you see the spiral turning through alone
And you feel so heavy that you just can't stop it
When this sea of madness turns you into stone
Picture of your life shoots like a rocket
All the time
Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it's all cut through you
From nowhere,
To nowhere,
Cut together, 
Cutting through
I'm island-bound, a mote inside my eye
I can't see you breathing as before
I am airless, a vacuum child
I can't stand to reason at your door
In this time
Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it's all cut through you
From nowhere,
To nowhere,
Come together
I'm down in the daytime out of sight
Comin' in from dreamland I'm on fire
I can see it's all been here before
Dream a dream that lies right at your door
When the seasons circle sideways out of turn
And words don't speak just fall across the carpet
You're just in time to watch the fires burn
It seems a crime but your face is bright you love it
All the time...

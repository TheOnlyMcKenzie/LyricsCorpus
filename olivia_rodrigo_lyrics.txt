I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah)
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah)
(Just havin' a really good time)
Got a broken ego, broken heart
(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start
----
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid?
Ain't it funny?
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleeping in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way
You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still
You're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Red lights
Stop signs
I still see your face
In the white cars
Front yards
Can't drive past the places
We used to
Go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe
Sidewalks
We crossed
I still hear your voice
In the traffic
We're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue
Know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe
I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street
----
Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I gave you power over that kind of stuff
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy? I don't understand
No, I don't understand
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home cryin'?
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy? I don't understand
No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe, this is all your fault instead
It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the roller coaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy?
I don't understand
No, I don't understand

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin'
To all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu?
Do you get déjà vu?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu?
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world
And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl
Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that?
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

I wore make-up when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you like
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favourite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books so you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave
You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
And maybe I'm just not as interesting as the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less about
Someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now, I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back before
You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
Don't you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I'm so exciting
And you'll be the one who's cryin'
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
For you
Enough for you
No, nothing's enough for you
----
We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine
You know I know you've moved on
Found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet
She's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm picking her apart
Like cutting her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful
She looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies
I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best
Really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy
But don't be happier
I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
Can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care
I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me (He-he-he, he)
Started followin' me (He-he-he, he)
And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy
Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but
I can't help gettin' caught up in it all
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy (Yeah)
All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy
Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be (Oh, oh)
Anyone, anyone else (Anybody else)
Jealousy, jealousy
Oh, I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be (Oh-oh-oh)
Anyone, anyone else
Jealousy, jealousy started followin' me
----
Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey
And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody
The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now, every time a siren sounds
I wonder if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again
Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was going down, but I was doing it with you
Yeah, everything we broke, and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became
Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
Oh, the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause baby, you were mine

I am light as a feather, I'm as stiff as a board
I pay attention to things that most people ignore
And I'm alright with the movies
That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty, that's for sure
And I am built like a mother and a total machine
I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean
And I make light of the darkness
I've got sun in my motherfuckin' pocket, best believe
Yeah, you know me, I
Forgive, and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm the perfect all-American
I am light as a feather, I'm as fresh as the air
Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair
I got class and integrity
Just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear
With love to spare, I
Forgive, and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm the perfect all-American bitch
With perfect all-American lips
And perfect all-American hips
I know my place
I know my place, 
And this is it!
I don't get angry when I'm pissed
I'm the eternal optimist
I scream inside to deal with it, like, "Ah"
Like, "Ah" (Oh my fucking God)
All the time
I'm grateful all the time
I'm sexy, and I'm kind
I'm pretty when I cry
Oh, all the time
I'm grateful all the time (Grateful all the fucking time)
I'm sexy, and I'm kind
I'm pretty when I cry

Haven't heard from you in a couple of months
But I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up
And you're callin' my phone and you're all alone
And I'm sensing some undertone
And I'm right here with all my friends
But you're sending me your new address
And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine
Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed
Now I'm gettin' in the car, wreckin' all my plans
I know I should stop, but I can't
And I told my friends I was asleep
But I never said where or in whose sheets
And I pull up to your place on the second floor
And you're standing, smiling at the door
And I'm sure I've seen much hotter men
But I really can't remember when
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not
Seeing you tonight

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naïve
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire
Every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy God I hate the way I called them crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naïve
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire
You said it was true love
But wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone
'Cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out
Now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing
I'll never understand
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naïve
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

Lacy, oh, Lacy, skin like puff pastry
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies
Did I ever tell you that I'm not doin' well?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time
Watching, hidden in plain sight
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear
Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin' it lately
I feel your compliments like bullets on skin
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnate
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?
Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots
You got the one thing that I want
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
Try to rationalize, people are people, but
It's like you're made of angel dust
Lacy, oh, Lacy, it's like you're out to get me
You poison every little thing that I do
Lacy, oh, Lacy, I just loathe you lately
And I despise my jealous eyes and how hard they fell for you
Yeah, I despise my rotten mind and how much it worships you

Cat got my tongue
And I don't think I get along with anyone
Blood running cold
I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
And I hate all my clothes
Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
So I guess I should go
The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know
I know, I know
I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy (Uh-huh)
Searchin' "how to start a conversation?" on a website (How to flirt?)
I talked to this hot guy, swore I was his type
Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like the whole night (Oh)
Everythin' I do is tragic (Oh)
Every guy I like is gay (Oh)
The morning after I panic (Oh)
Oh God, what did I say? (Oh, oh, oh)
I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
Yeah, when I'm alone, I'm fine
But don't let me out at night
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
I broke a glass, tripped and fell
Told secrets I shouldn't tell
Stumbled over all my words
Made it weird, then made it worse
Each day that I'm alive
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Don't let me out at night
I'm shocked I'm still alive
It's social suicide
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Thought your mom was your wife (Ah)
Called you the wrong name twice (Ah)
Can't think of a third line (Ah)

Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done
Another thing I ruined, I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign
Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed
And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city, and the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light, can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined
Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed
Sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Countin' all of the beautiful things I regret
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Makin' the bed, oh-oh

Master manipulator
God, you're so good at what you do
Come for me like a savior
And I'd put myself through hell for you
Hear all the rumors lately
That you always denied
And I fell for you like water
Falls from the February sky
But now the current's stronger
And I couldn't get out if I tried
But you convinced me, baby
It was all in my mind
And now you got me thinking
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
No, love is never logical
You built a giant castle
With walls so high, I couldn't see
The way it all unraveled
And all the things you did to me
You lied, you lied, you lied
Oh
And now you got me thinkin'
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
I guess love is never logical
The sky is green, the grass is red
And you mean all those words you said
I'm sure that girl is really your friend
Our problems are all solvable
'Cause lovin' you is lovin' every
Argument you held over my head
Brought up the girls you could have instead
Said I was too young, I was too soft
Can't take a joke, can't get you off
Oh, why do I do this?
I look so stupid thinkin'
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
No, love is never logical
Logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible and that makes me feel horrible
Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all, God, why didn't I stop it all?
Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible and that makes me feel horrible
Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all, God, why didn't I stop it all?

I met a guy in the summer and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"
But he was so much fun and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when he said something wrong, he'd just fly me to France
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back
So I write him all these letters, then I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting "send"
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)
I want to get him back, back, back
I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)
I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna break his heart (But then I, I want to get him back)
Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back)
Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)
With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna meet his mom (But then I, I want to get him back)
Just to tell her her son sucks (But then I, I want to get him back)
Oh, I wanna key his car, I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back, I want to)
I wanna break his heart, stitch it right back up (But then I, I want to get him back, get him back)
I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back, I want to)
I wanna meet his mom and tell her her son sucks, yeah (But then I, I want to get him back, get him back)
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)
I want to get him back (Back, back)
I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him back (Woo-hoo)
Get him back (Come on, come on, woo)
I'm gonna get him so good, he's not even gonna know what hit him
He's gonna love me and hate me at the same time
(Get him back, girl, you better get him back)
(You got it, got it)
Oh, I don't know, I got him good, I got him really good

I told my friends you were the one
After I'd known you like a month
And then you kissed some girl from high school
And I stayed in bed for like a week
When you said space was what you need
Waited by my phone like a goddamn fool
And now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell
And I consoled you while you cried
Over your ex-girlfriend's new guy
My God, how could I be so stupid?
You found a new version of me
And I damn near started World War III
Jesus, what was I even doing?
'Cause now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell
I give up, give up
I give up everything
I placed my bets and
It's not worth anything
I give up, give up
But I keep comin' back for more
Yeah, it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell
Yeah, yeah, I give up, give up
I give up everything
I'm plannin' out my wedding
With some guy I'm never marryin'
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up
But I keep comin' back for more

When am I gonna stop being wise beyond my years and just start being wise?
When am I gonna stop being a pretty young thing to guys?
When am I gonna stop being great for my age and just start being good?
When will it stop being cool to be quietly misunderstood?
I'll blow out the candles, happy birthday to me
Got your whole life ahead of you, you're only nineteen
But I fear that they already got all the best parts of me
And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream
And when does wide-eyed affection and all good intentions start to not be enough?
When will everyone have every reason to call all my bluffs?
And when are all my excuses of learning my lessons gonna start to feel sad?
Will I spend all the rest of my years wishing I could go back?
I'll blow out the candles, happy birthday to me
Got your whole life ahead of you, you're only nineteen
But I fear that they already got all the best parts of me
And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream
They all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't?
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't?
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't?
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't?

You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you around
Saying everything is broken
Everyone is broken
You can force it but it will stay strong
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it
You can break all the rules
But still
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is broken
Everything is broken
Why can't you forget me?
Why can't you forget me?
Why can't you forget me?

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
Alone on an aerplane
Falling asleep beside the window pane
My blood'll thicken
I need to wash myself again to hide all the the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared but there's nothing underneath
Who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am i really sinking this low?
Baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends, no no no
Lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties
I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
Brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
To blow me sky high
Baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends
Lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties
I wish we could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race
race, race, race
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now?
When I need you

Two jumps in a week I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk & all your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you when you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
It's the best thing that you ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing that you've had has gone away
So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
don't leave me dry

The green plastic watering can
For a fake chinese rubberplant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery for girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
And it wears him out
And it wears him out
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
if I just turned and ran
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
If I could be who you wanted
if I could be who you wanted all the time
----
I don't want to be crippled cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac, painkillers
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
And I used to fly like peter pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

They love me like I was a brother
They protect me
Listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine
Made me happy
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
I call up my friend the good angel
But she's out with her ansaphone
She says that she would love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream (If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream (If you think you belong enough)
Nice dream (If you think that you're strong enough)

Now come on

Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
You do it to yourself, you do
and that's why it really hurts, is
You do it to yourself
Just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Don't get my sympathy hanging out the 15th floor
Changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
And soon he'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts is
You do it to yourself
Just you, you and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self

Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support
My iron lung
The headshrinkers
They want everything
My uncle bill
By belisha beacon
We're way too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
A twentieth century bitch
And we are grateful for our iron lung
The headshrinkers
They want everything
My uncle bill
By belisha beacon
Suck
Suck your teenage thumb
toilet trained and dumb
when the power runs out we'll just hum
This
This is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung
The headshrinkers
They want everything
My uncle bill
By belisha beacon
And if you're frightened
You could be frightened
You can be
It's OK
And if you're frightened
You could be frightened
You can be
It's OK

Limb by limb and tooth by tooth, tearing up inside of me
Every day, every hour
Wish that I was bulletproof
Wax me
Mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it was bulletproof
So pay me money, take a shot
Lead-fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bulletproof
And bullet proof

I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
Troubled words of a troubled mind
I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but it's 58 hours since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am i coming to?
I'm gonna melt down
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

You bite through the big wall
The big wall bites back
You sit there and sulk
Sit there and bawl
You're so pretty
When you're on your knees
Disaffected and eager to please
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad
You'll never change
Each time it comes it eats me alive
I try to behave but it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep drift away
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul when the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad
You'll never change

Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out
This machine will
Will not communicate these thoughts and this strain I am under
Be a world child form a circle before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs dead birds scream as they fight for life
I can feel death can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love

In the next world war
A jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In a deep deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that?
What's that?
When I am king you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that?
What's that?
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking and squealing gucci little piggy
You don't remember
You don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does
Rain down
Rain down
Come on rain down
On me
From a great height
From a great height
Height
Height
That's it sir (Rain down)
You're leaving
The crackle of pig skin (Rain down)
The dust and the screaming (Come on rain down on me)
The yuppies networking
The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
The panic, the vomit (from a great height)
God loves his children

The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
And up above aliens hover making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets
They're all uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me onboard that beautiful ship
Show me the worlds I'd love to see
I'd tell all my friends but they never believe me
They'd think that I've finally lost it completely
I show them the stars and the meaning of life, they'd shut me away but I'd be all right all right
I'm just uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight

Wake
From your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape
We escape
Pack
And get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing us a song, a song to keep us warm
There's such a chill, such a chill
And You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
And now we are one
In everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke

Transport
Motorways and tram lines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
And when it comes its so so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed
Juices flowing
Wings twitch legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I'm going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
You know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapses
Floating
Bouncing back and one day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best when the light is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends 'til we die
And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling
That either way he turns
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls

No alarms and no surprises
Silent

My final bellyache with

Turn me on to phantoms

Everybody leaves

Picked over by the worms

As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back and focus again
The walls are bending shape
You got a cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are a sawn off shotgun
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mike
Just as you dance, dance, dance
Jigsaws falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
you eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once
And not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light you can feel it on your back
You got the light you can feel it on your back
Jigsaws falling into place

We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors
And if you float you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live

Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
And it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done
This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
The white room
By window
Where the sun goes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You
----
And in your life, there comes a darkness
This spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to look back and you call on your knees
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Now we're trapped we're dark cast people
We are helpless to this
In your darkest hour
But it was just a lie, just a lie
Just a lie, just a lie
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
Still turning heads, you know where it's at
This dread still covers us
You gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, and it's dark now
It was just a laugh, it was just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
It feels infinite
And in your life, there comes a darkness
This spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to look back and you call on your knees
But there's a lighter sound, you'll never know
Now we're trapped we're dark cast people
We are helpless to this
In your darkest hour
We will never know
We will never know
So dark
So dark
So dark
So dark

Help as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light
Born of a light
The wind rushing round my open heart
An open ravine
With my spirit white
Totally alive
And my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a stream
To another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light
One I didn't know
Totally alive
Totally relieved
Waking up, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of you
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible

You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
But you can take it all back again
Strike up what's in the box
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
Still trapped in your full stop
Two fools stop
Two fools stop
Two fools stop
Two fools
Two fools
Two fools
Two fools
(All the good times)
Two fools
Two fools
(All the good times)
Two fools
Two fools
(All the good times)
Two fools
Two fools
(All the good times)
Two fools
Two fools
Take me back
Take me back again
Take me back
Take me back again
You really me
Really mess
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time

Hey it's me
I just got off the train
A frightening place
Their faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket
Panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great job, no message coming in
And you're so small
Glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day
The path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
And the path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
I feel this often, go
I feel this often, go

Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all can love
When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
Broken hearts make it rain
Pieces of the wreck of mankind
That you can't create
That we can create
That we can create
But now I see you messing me around
And I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know.

It holds us like a phantom
The touch is like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
And we're not at the mercy
Of your shimmerers or spells
Your shimmerers or spells
Mmmhm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
(One day at a time)
One day at a time
We call upon the people
People have this power
The numbers don't decide
Your system is a lie
The river running dry
The wings of a butterfly
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours
One day at a time

This dance
This dance
It's like a weapon
Like a weapon
Of self defense
Self defense
Against the present
Against the present
Present tense
I won't get heavy
Don't get heavy
Keep it light and
Keep it moving
I am doing
No harm
As my world
Comes crashing down
I'm dancing
Freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
I won't turn around when the penny drops
I won't stop now
I won't slack off
Or all this love
Will be in vain
Stop from falling
Down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
That all this love
Could be in vain
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
----
All the holes at once are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind, lonely
And they pray
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Crawling out upon, expending
And all you have to do is say yeah
All the birds stay up in the trees
All the fish swim down too deep
And they pray
Honey, come to me before it's too late
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon, expelling
And all you have to do is say yeah
----
I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living, I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands, your crazy-kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave
